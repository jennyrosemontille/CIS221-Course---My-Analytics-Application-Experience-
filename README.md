3.1 Challenges I Experienced 

I struggled with cleaning and preparing the data, especially when handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data formats. I found it difficult to identify which variables were important during exploratory data analysis. Interpreting graphs, statistical results, and regression outputs was also challenging, particularly because I was still learning the assumptions behind inferential analysis and regression techniques. In addition, selecting appropriate regression models for machine learning was confusing due to my limited experience and understanding.

3.2 Reasons and Lessons Learned

These challenges occurred because I had limited exposure to real-world datasets, which are often messy and complex. My lack of a strong foundation in statistics and regression theory made it harder to correctly interpret analytical results. I also had limited domain knowledge, which affected how I understood patterns and relationships in the data. From this experience, I learned the importance of proper data preprocessing, understanding theoretical concepts, and carefully interpreting results to ensure accurate analysis.

3.3 What I Need to Do Better Next Time

Next time, I need to allocate more time for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. I should review statistical concepts and regression assumptions before applying any models. Gaining more hands-on practice with different datasets will help improve my confidence in model selection and evaluation. I also need to document each step of my analysis clearly to better understand my workflow and improve future data analytics projects.
